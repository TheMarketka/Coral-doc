\section*{Preface}

Coral is a Ruby-like programming language which enhances advanced object- oriented programming with elements of functional programming. Every value is an object, in this sense it is a pure object-oriented language. Object blueprints are described by classes. Classes can be composed in multiple ways â€“ classic inheritance, mixin composition, union and compound types.

Coral is also a functional language in the sense that every function is also an object. Therefore, function definitions can be nested and higher-order functions are supported out-of-the-box. Coral also has a limited support for pattern matching, which can emulate the algebraic types used in other functional languages.

Coral has been developed from 2012 in a home environment out of pure enthusiasm for programming and out of a desire for a truly versatile language. This document is a work in progress and will stay that way forever. It acts as a reference for the language definition and some core library classes.

\chapter{Lexical Syntax}

Coral programs are written using the Unicode character set; Unicode supplementary characters are supported as well. Coral programs are preferably encoded with the \textsc{UTF-8} character encoding. While every Unicode character is supported, usage of Unicode escapes is encouraged, since fonts that IDEs might use may not support the full Unicode character set.
