\chapter{Lexical Syntax}

Coral programs are written using the Unicode character set; Unicode supplementary characters are supported as well. Coral programs are preferably encoded with the UTF-8 character encoding. While every Unicode character is supported, usage of Unicode escapes is encouraged, since fonts that IDEs might use may not support the full Unicode character set.

Grammar of lexical tokens is given in the following sections. These tokens are then used as terminal symbols of the semantical grammar. 

To construct tokens, characters are distinguished according to the following classes (Unicode general category given in parentheses):
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Whitespace characters. \Unicode{0020} | \Unicode{0009} | \Unicode{000D} | \Unicode{000A} (space, tab character, carriage return, line feed)

\item
Letters, which include lower case letters (Ll), upper case letters (Lu), title-case letters (Lt), other letters (Lo), letter numerals (Nl), modifier letters (Lm) and the two characters \Unicode{0024} `\lstinline[mathescape=false]!$!' and \Unicode{005F} `\lstinline!_!', which both count as upper case letters. 

\item
Digits `\lstinline!0!' | \ldots \thinspace | `\lstinline!9!'. 

\item
Parentheses. `\lstinline!(!' | `\lstinline!)!' | `\lstinline![!' | `\lstinline!]!' | `\lstinline!{!' | `\lstinline!}!'

\item
Delimiter characters. `\lstinline!'!' | `\lstinline!"!' | `\lstinline!.!' | `\lstinline!;!' | '\lstinline!,!'

\item
Operator characters. These consist of all printable ASCII characters \UnicodeRange{0020}{007F} that are in none of the sets above, mathematical symbols (Sm) and other symbols (So). 
\end{itemize}

\section{Identifiers}
\label{sec:identifiers}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
simple_id     ::= (lower | '_') [id_rest]
variable_id   ::= simple_id | '_' | '`' simple_id '`'
ivar_id       ::= '@' simple_id
cvar_id       ::= '@@' simple_id
op_id         ::= opchar {opchar}
function_id   ::= simple_id [id_rest_fun]
                | '`' simple_id [id_rest_fun] '`'
                | '`' op_id '`'
constant_id   ::= upper [id_rest_con]
                | '`' upper [id_rest_con] '`'
id_rest       ::= {letter | digit | '_'}
id_rest_con   ::= id_rest [id_rest_mid]
id_rest_fun   ::= id_rest [id_rest_mid] [['_'] op_id]
id_rest_mid   ::= id_rest {('/' | '+' | '-') id_rest}
id            ::= variable_id | constant_id
importable_id ::= simple_id
                | function_id
                | constant_id
\end{lstlisting}

There are three kinds of identifiers.

First, \textit{variable identifiers}, which are simply a lower-case letter followed by arbitrary sequence of letters (any-case), digits and underscores, or just one underscore (which has special meaning). Additionally, \textit{instance variable identifiers} are just prepended with a ``\lstinline|@|'' sign and \textit{class instance variable identifiers} are just prefixed with ``\lstinline|@@|''. 

Second, \textit{function identifiers}, which are the most complicated ones. They can start as a variable identifier, then optionally followed by one of ``\lstinline@/@'', ``+'' and ``\lstinline@-@'', and then optionally ended with ``\lstinline@?@'', ``\lstinline@!@'' or ``\lstinline@=@''. Furthermore, function identifiers ending with ``\lstinline@=@'' are never used at call site with this last character, but without it and as a target of an assignment expression (they are naming simple setters). 

And third, \textit{constant identifiers}, which are just like function identifiers, but starting with an upper-case letter, never just an underscore and never ending with ``\lstinline@?@'', ``\lstinline@!@'' or ``\lstinline@=@''.

An identifier may also be formed by an identifier between back-quotes (``\lstinline!$~$`$~$!''), to resolve possible name clashes with Coral keywords. Instance variable names (\code{ivar_id}) and class instance variable names (\code{cvar_id}) never clash with a keyword name, since these are distinguished by the preceding ~``\lstinline!@!''~ and ~``\lstinline!@@!''~ respectively. 

Coral programs are parsed greedily, so that a longest match rule applies. Letters from the syntax may be any Unicode letters, but English alphabet letters are recommended, along with English names.

\section{Keywords}\label{sec:keywords}
A set of identifiers is reserved for language features instead of for user identifiers. However, unlike in most other languages, keywords are not being recognized inside of paths, except for a few specific cases.

The following names are the reserved words.

\begin{lstlisting}
abstract      advice        advice-execution            after
alias         annotation    arguments     around        as
aspect        begin         before        bitfield      break
broken        case          catch         class         clone
cloned        constant      constructor   declare       def
delta         destructor    digits        do            else
elsif         end           ensure        enum          execution
exhausted     extends       final         for           for-some
function      get           goto          handler       if
indexed-with  implements    implicit      in            include
interface     invoke        is            label         lazy
let           loop          match         memoize       message
method        module        native        next          nil
no            object        of            opaque        operator
out           override      pointcut      pragma        prepend
private       property      protected     protocol      public
raise         raising       range         record        redo
refine        refinement    rescue        retry         return
returning     requires      reverse       sealed        self
set           skip          step          super         target
then          this          throw         throwing      trait
transparent   type          unless        until         union
unit-of-measure             use           val           var
yes           weak          when          while         with
yield
\end{lstlisting}

Not every reserved word is a keyword in every context, this behavior will be further explained. For example, the bitfield reserved word is only recognized as a keyword inside an enumeration definition context, in a specific place. Every reserved word may be used as a function identifier, with a little work-around when used with an implicit receiver.

\section{Newline Characters}\label{sec:newlinecharacters}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
semi ::= nl {nl} | ';'
\end{lstlisting}

Coral is a line-oriented language, in which statements are expressions and may be terminated by newlines, as well as by semi-colon operator. A newline in a Coral source file is treated as the special separator token \lstinline@nl@ if the following criterion is satisfied:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The token immediately preceding the newline can terminate an expression.
\end{enumerate}

Since Coral may be interpreted in a REPL\footnote{Read-Eval-Print Loop} fashion, there are no other suitable criteria. Such a token that can terminate an expression is, for instance, not a binary operator or a message sending operator, which both require further tokens to create an expression. Keywords that expect any following tokens also can not terminate expressions. Coral interpreters and compilers do not look-ahead beyond newlines.

If the token immediately preceding the newline can not terminate an expression and is followed by more than one newline, Coral still sees that as only a one significant newline, to prevent any confusion.

Keywords that can terminate an expression are: \lstinline@break@, \lstinline@end@, \lstinline@opaque@, \lstinline@native@, \lstinline@next@, \lstinline@nil@, \lstinline@no@, \lstinline@redo@, \lstinline@retry@, \lstinline@return@, \lstinline@self@, \lstinline@skip@, \lstinline@super@, \lstinline@this@, \lstinline@transparent@, \lstinline@yes@, \lstinline@yield@.

\section{Operators}\label{sec:operators}
A set of identifiers is reserved for language features, some of which may be overridden by user space implementations. Operators have language-defined precedence rules that are supposed to usually comply to user expectations (principle of least surprise), and another desired precedence may be obtained by putting expressions with operators inside of parenthesis pairs. 

The following character sequences are the operators recognized by Coral. 

\begin{lstlisting}
:=     +=     -=     *=     **=    /=     %=     ||=    &&=    ^^= 
|=     &=     |=     [      ^=     ~=     <<     >>     <<<    >>> 
<<=    >>=    <<<=   >>>=   ;      =      !=     ==     !==    === 
!===   =~     !~     <>     <      >      <=     >=     <=>    + 
-      *      **     /      div    %      mod    ||     or     && 
and    !      not    ^^     xor    |      &      ^      ~      .. 
...    ,      ->     <-     ~>     <~     =>     ::     :      <: 
:>     <<|    |>>    <|     |>     (      )      [      ]      { 
}      .      [<     >]     >:     .?     .!     rem
\end{lstlisting}

Some of these operators have multiple meanings, usually up to two. Some are binary, some are unary, none is ternary. 

Binary (infix) operators have to be separated by whitespace or non-letter characters on both sides, unary operators on left side â€“ the right side is what they are bound to. 

Unary operators are: \lstinline@+@, \lstinline@-@, \lstinline@&@, \lstinline@not@, \lstinline@!@ and \lstinline@~@. The first three of these are binary as well. The \lstinline@;@ operator is used to separate expressions (see \nameref{sec:newlinecharacters}). Parentheses are postcircumfix operators. Coral has no postfix operators. 

Coral allows for custom user-defined operators, but those have the lowest precedence and need to be parenthesized in order to express any precedence. Such custom operators can't be made of letter characters. 

\section{Literals}\label{sec:literals}

There are literals for numbers (including integer, floating point and complex), characters, booleans, strings, symbols, regular expressions and collections (including tuples, lists, dictionaries and bags). 

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
literal ::= integer_literal
	      | floating_point_literal
	      | complex_literal
	      | character_literal
	      | string_literal
	      | symbol_literal
	      | regular_expression_literal
	      | Collection_Literal
	      | 'nil'
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Integer Literals}\label{sec:integerliterals}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
integer_literal     ::= ['+' | '-'] (decimal_numeral
	                  | hexadecimal_numeral
	                  | octal_numeral
	                  | binary_numeral)
decimal_numeral     ::= '0' | non_zero_digit {['_'] digit}
hexadecimal_numeral ::= '0x' | hex_digit {['_'] hex_digit}
digit               ::= '0' | non_zero_digit
non_zero_digit      ::= '1' | $\cdots$ | '9'
hex_digit           ::= '1' | $\cdots$ | '9' | 'a' | $\cdots$ | 'f'
octal_numeral       ::= '0' oct_digit {'_' oct_digit}
oct_digit           ::= '0' | $\cdots$ | '7'
binary_numeral      ::= '0b' bin_digit {['_'] bin_digit}
bin_digit           ::= '0' | '1'
\end{lstlisting}
Integers are usually of type \lstinline@Number@, which is a class cluster of all classes that can represent numbers. Unlike Java, Coral supports both signed and unsigned integers directly. Usually integer literals that are obviously unsigned integers are automatically represented internally by a class that stores the integer unsigned, like \lstinline@Integer_64_Unsigned@. Math operations on numbers are handled internally in such a way that the user does't need to worry about the actual types of the numbers â€” when an integer overflow would occur, the result is stored in a larger container type. 

Underscores used in integer literals have no special meaning, other than to improve readability of larger literals, i.e., to separate thousands.

Integral members of the \lstinline@Number@ class cluster include the following container types. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item \lstinline@Integer_8@ ($-2^{7}$ to $2^{7}-1$), alias \lstinline@Byte@

\item \lstinline@Integer_8_Unsigned@ ($0$ to $2^{8}$), alias \lstinline@Byte_Unsigned@

\item \lstinline@Integer_16@ ($-2^{15}$ to $2^{15}-1$), alias \lstinline@Short@

\item \lstinline@Integer_16_Unsigned@ ($0$ to $2^{16}$), alias \lstinline@Short_Unsigned@

\item \lstinline@Integer_32@ ($-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$)

\item \lstinline@Integer_32_Unsigned@ ($0$ to $2^{32}$)

\item \lstinline@Integer_64@ ($-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$), alias \lstinline@Long@

\item \lstinline@Integer_64_Unsigned@ ($0$ to $2^{64}$), alias \lstinline@Long_Unsigned@

\item \lstinline@Integer_128@ ($-2^{127}$ to $2^{127}-1$), alias \lstinline@Double_Long@

\item \lstinline@Integer_128_Unsigned@ ($0$ to $2^{128}$), alias \lstinline@Double_Long_Unsigned@

\item \lstinline@Decimal@ ($-\infty$ to $\infty$)

\item \lstinline@Decimal_Unsigned@ ($0$ to $\infty$)

\end{enumerate}

The special \lstinline@Decimal@ \& \lstinline@Decimal_Unsigned@ container types are also for storing arbitrary precision floating point numbers. All the container types are constants defined in the \lstinline@Number@ class and can be imported into scope if needed. 

Moreover, a helper type \lstinline@Number.Unsigned@ exists, which can be used for type casting in cases where an originally signed number needs to be treated as unsigned. 

Weak conformance applies to the inner members of \lstinline@Number@ class. 

For use with range types, \lstinline@Number.Integer@ and \lstinline@Number.Integer_Unsigned@ exist, to allow constraining of the range types to integral numbers.

\subsection{Floating Point Literals}\label{sec:floatliterals}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
float_literal ::= ['+' | '-'] non_zero_digit 
		          {['_'] digit} '.' digit {['_'] digit}
		          [exponent_part] [float_type]
	            | ['+' | '-'] digit {['_'] digit} exponent_part 
	              [float_type]
	            | ['+' | '-'] digit {['_'] digit} [exponent_part] 
	              float_type
	            | ['+' | '-'] '0x' hex_digit
		          {['_'] hex_digit} '.' hex_digit 
		          {['_'] hex_digit} [float_type]
	            | ['+' | '-'] '0b' bin_digit
		          {['_'] bin_digit} '.' bin_digit 
		          {['_'] bin_digit} [float_type]
exponent_part ::= 'e' ['+' | '-'] digit {['_'] digit}
float_type    ::= 'f' | 'd' | 'q' | 'df'
\end{lstlisting}

Floating point literals are of type \lstinline@Number@ as well as integral literals, and have fewer container types. Compiler infers the precision automatically, unless the \lstinline@float_type@ part is present. Floating point literals that have \lstinline@float_type@ of ``\code{dp}'' are decimal fixed point literals. Also, floating point literals that are impossible to represent in binary form accurately are implicitly fixed point literals. From user's perspective, this is only an implementation detail. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item \lstinline@Float_32@ (IEEE 754 32-bit precision), alias \lstinline@Float@. 

\item \lstinline@Float_64@ (IEEE 754 64-bit precision), alias \lstinline@Double@.

\item \lstinline@Float_128@ (IEEE 754 128-bit precision).

\item \lstinline@Decimal@ ($-\infty$ to $\infty$).

\item \lstinline@Decimal_Unsigned@ ($0$ to $\infty$).

\end{enumerate}

Letters in the exponent type and float type literals have to be lower-case in Coral sources, but functions that parse floating point numbers do support them being upper-case for compatibility. 

\subsection{Imaginary Number Literals}\label{sec:imaginaryliterals}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
imaginary_literal ::= real_number_literal 'i'
complex_literal ::= real_number_literal ('+' | '-') imaginary_literal
	| imaginary_literal ('+' | '-') real_number_literal
real_number_literal ::= integer_literal | float_literal
number_literal ::= real_number_literal
	| imaginary_literal
	| complex_literal
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Units of Measure}
\label{sec:unitsofmeasuresyntax}

Coral has an addition to number handling, called {\em units of measure} (\sref{sec:units-of-measure}). Number instances can be annotated with a unit of measure to ensure correctness of arithmetic operations. 

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
annotated_number ::= number_literal '[<' uom_expr '>]'
uom_expr         ::= Unit_Conv {',' Unit_Conv}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Character Literals}\label{sec:characterliterals}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
character_literal ::= '%'' (character | unicode_escape) '''
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Boolean Literals}\label{sec:booleanliterals}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
boolean_literal ::= 'yes' | 'no'
\end{lstlisting}

Both literals are members of type \lstinline@Boolean@. The \lstinline@no@ literal has also a special behavior when being compared to \lstinline@nil@: \lstinline@no@ equals to \lstinline@nil@, while not actually being \lstinline@nil@. Identity equality is indeed different, and \code{no} does not match in pattern matching (\sref{sec:pattern-matching}) as \code{nil} and vice versa. The implication is that both \lstinline@nil@ and \lstinline@no@ are false conditions in \lstinline@if@-expressions. 

\subsection{String Literals}\label{sec:stringliterals}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
string_literal              ::= simple_string_literal 
                              | interpolable_string_literal
simple_string_literal       ::= ''' {string_element} '''
string_element              ::= printable_char | char_escape_seq
interpolable_string_literal ::= '"' {int_string_element} '"'
int_string_element          ::= string_element | interpolated_expr
interpolated_expr           ::= '#{' expr '}'
\end{lstlisting}

String literals are members of the type \lstinline@String@. Single quotes in simple string literals have to be escaped (\lstinline@\'@) and double quotes in interpolable string literals have to be escaped (\lstinline@\"@). Interpolated expression can be preceded only by an even number of escape characters (backslashes, \lstinline@\@), so that the \lstinline@#@ does't get escaped. This is a special \textit{requirement} for any Coral compiler. 

\subsection{Symbol Literals}\label{sec:symbolliterals}


\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
symbol_literal       ::= simple_symbol | quoted_symbol
simple_symbol        ::= ':' simple_id
quoted_symbol        ::= simple_quoted_symbol | interpolable_symbol
simple_quoted_symbol ::= ':'' {string_element} '''
interpolable_symbol  ::= ':"' {int_string_element} '"'
\end{lstlisting}

Symbol literals are members of the type \lstinline@Symbol@. They differ from \nameref{sec:stringliterals} in the way runtime handles them: while there may be multiple instances of the same string, there is always up to one instance of the same symbol. Unlike in Ruby, they do get released from memory when no code references to them anymore, so their object id (sometimes) varies with time. Coral does not require their ids to be constant in time. 

\subsection{Type Parameters}\label{sec:typeparameterliterals}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=false]
tp_id ::= '$' constant_id
\end{lstlisting}

Type parameters are not members of any type, rather they stand-in for a real type, like a variable which only holds types. 

\subsection{Regular Expression Literals}\label{sec:regexpliterals}

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
regexp_literal     ::= '%/' regexp_content_int '/' [regexp_flags]
	                 | '%r/' regexp_content_int '/' [regexp_flags]
	                 | '%r#' regexp_content '#' [regexp_flags]
	                 | '%r~' regexp_content_int '~' [regexp_flags]
regexp_content_int ::= regexp_element_int {regexp_element_int}
regexp_element_int ::= string_element | int_string_element
regexp_content     ::= string_element {string_element}
regexp_flags       ::= printable_char {printable_char}
\end{lstlisting}

Regular expression literals are members of the type \lstinline@Regular_Expression@ with alias of \lstinline@Regexp@. 

\subsection{Collection Literals}\label{sec:collectionliterals}

Collection literals are paired syntax tokens and as such, they are a kind of parentheses in Coral sources. 

\syntax\begin{lstlisting}
Collection_Literal ::= Tuple_Literal
	                 | List_literal
	                 | Dictionary_Literal
	                 | Bag_Literal
Tuple_Literal      ::= '(' Exprs ')'
List_Literal       ::= '%' Collection_Flags '[' Exprs ']'
Dictionary_Literal ::= '%' Collection_Flags '{' Dict_Exprs '}'
Bag_Literal        ::= '%' Collection_Flags '(' Exprs ')'
Dict_Exprs         ::= Dict_Expr {',' Dict_Expr}
Dict_Expr          ::= Expr '=>' Expr
	                 | simple_id ':' Expr
Collection_Flags   ::= printable_char {printable_char}
\end{lstlisting}

Tuple literals are members of the \lstinline@Tuple@ type family. List literals are members of the \lstinline@List@ type, usually \lstinline@Array_List@ with alias of \lstinline@Array@. Dictionary literals are members of the \lstinline@Dictionary@ type with alias of \lstinline@Map@, usually \lstinline@Hash_Dictionary@ with alias of \lstinline@Hash_Map@. Bag literals are members of the \lstinline@Bag@ type, usually \lstinline@Hash_Bag@ or \lstinline@Hash_Set@. Collection flags may change the actual class of the literal, along with some other properties, described in the following text. 

List literal collection flags: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Flag \lstinline@i@ = \textbf{i}mmutable, makes the list frozen. 
\item Flag \lstinline@l@ = \textbf{l}inked, makes the list a member of \lstinline@Linked_List@. 
\item Flag \lstinline@w@ = \textbf{w}ords, the following expressions are treated as words, converted to strings for each word separated by whitespace. 
\end{enumerate}

Dictionary literals collection flags:


\begin{enumerate}
\item Flag \lstinline@i@ = \textbf{i}mmutable, makes the dictionary frozen. 
\item Flag \lstinline@l@ = \textbf{l}inked, makes the dictionary a member of \lstinline@Linked_Hash_Dictionary@ (also has alias \lstinline@Linked_Hash_Map@).
\item Flag \lstinline@m@ = \textbf{m}ulti-map, the dictionary items are then either the items themselves, if there is only one for a particular key, or a set of items, if there is more than one item for a particular key. The dictionary is then a member of \lstinline@Multi_Hash_Dictionary@ (alias \lstinline@Multi_Hash_Map@) or \lstinline@Linked_Multi_Hash_Dictionary@ (alias \lstinline@Linked_Multi_Hash_Map@). 
\end{enumerate}

Bag literal collection flags:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Flag \lstinline@i@ = \textbf{i}mmutable, makes the bag frozen. 
\item Flag \lstinline@s@ = \textbf{s}et, the collection is a set instead of a bag (a specific bag, such that for each item, its tally is always $0$ or $1$, thus each item is in the collection up to once). 
\item Flag \lstinline@l@ = \textbf{l}inked, makes the collection linked, so either a member of \lstinline@Linked_Hash_Bag@ in case of a regular bag, or \lstinline@Linked_Hash_Set@ in case of a set. 
\end{enumerate}

Linked collections have a predictable iteration order in case of bags and dictionaries, or are simply stored differently in case of lists.  

\section{Whitespace \& Comments}\label{sec:whitespacecomments}

Tokens may be separated by whitespace characters and/or comments. Comments come in two forms: 

A single-line comment is a sequence of characters that starts with \lstinline@//@ and extends to the end of the line. 

A multi-line comment is a sequence of characters between \lstinline@/*@ and \lstinline@*/@. Multi-line comments may be nested. 

Documentation comments are multi-line comments that start with \lstinline@/*!@.
