\chapter{Syntax}
\label{ch:aml-bootstrap-syntax}

The syntax of \AmlBootstrap is a subset of \AmlBase. It is not a programming language intended for direct programmer's use, instead, it is meant to be handled by programs, but still readable by programmers. Also, it is meant to bridge the gap between a world where \Aml does not exist and a world where it begins to exist; being interpreted by code written in a non-\Aml language. \AmlBootstrap code is used to implement \AmlBase, and to interact with the type system, thus bootstrapping any program written in the \Aml languages.
