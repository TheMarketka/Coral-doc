\label{ch:tools-amlbook}

This chapter will describe the Amlantis System's "Book Workspace" tool, which is a planned addition to the whole toolchain and supposed to be accompanied by a GUI. The purpose will be to work with source texts that intertwine program source code in snippets with rich text documents, and ability to selectively execute these program source codes, seeing results right below each snippet.
