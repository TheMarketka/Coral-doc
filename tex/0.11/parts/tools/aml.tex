\label{ch:tools-aml}

This chapter will describe the top-level system for the Amlantis System, which serves as universal entry point for running programs designed for this system. 

Without input files specified in arguments, it permits interactive use of the Amlantis System through a mechanism known as read-eval-print loop (REPL). With this mode, the system repeatedly reads user's input, evaluates it with the context of every previous input of the same REPL session, prints the inferred type of the result of such evaluation along with the text representation of the result, if any, and repeats.
