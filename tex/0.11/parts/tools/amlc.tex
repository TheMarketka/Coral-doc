\label{ch:tools-amlc}

In this chapter, we're going to describe the Amlantis System Compiler \lstinline!amlc!, which compiles source code files to bytecode files. The compilation process involves reading through the input source files, expanding them by evaluating the read programs by using the specified language, and serializing the type system's state along with modules' state to bytecode files, which are then to be run by \ToolAmlrun (\sref{ch:tools-amlrun}) or \ToolAml (\sref{ch:tools-aml}).
