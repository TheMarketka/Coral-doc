\section*{Preface}

This part is a specification of a programming language named Gear. 

%Gear has been developed since 2012 in a home environment out of pure enthusiasm for programming and out of a desire for a truly versatile language. This document is a work in progress and will stay that way forever. It acts as a reference for the language definition and some core library classes.

% TBD: move/rewrite to document introduction instead of language intro
%Some of the languages that had major influence on the development of Gear, including syntax and behavior patterns, are Ruby, Ada, Scala, Java, C\#, F\#, Clojure and ATS. Gear tries to inherit their good parts and put them together in its own way.
