\section*{Preface}

This part is a specification of a programming language named {\em Amlantis} (shorter {\em Aml}). 

Aml's name has quite some history. The project started being named {\em Coral}, but that collided with another language of a similar name, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_66}{{\em CORAL 66}}. Then it got renamed to {\em Gear}, but that again collided with another language of the same name, which seemed inactive at the time, \href{https://github.com/zippers/gear}{{\em zippers/gear}}. Than an idea was born and Aml was named {\em Amlantis}, which is whatever you want it to be. It could be a misspelling of {\em Atlantis}\footnote{Intentionally -- because otherwise, it would be named Atlantis, but there is already a city of that name.}, it could be an acronym like {\em A ML Language}, or maybe even something like {\em A ML Language And Neat Technology Improvement System}, or maybe {\em Caml} without the {\em C}. For the meaning of the cryptic {\em ML} part, search for the {\em Standard ML} or {\em OCaml}.
