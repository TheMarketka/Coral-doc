\section[About The Amlantis\# System Language]{About The \AmlSharpTitle System Language}

\AmlSharpSystem is a language that targets a more low-level runtime: the System Runtime. It has syntax mostly similar to that of \Aml, with minor adjustments, regarding the static-ness of the System Runtime, which is not a dynamic runtime. 

The differences from \Aml are described in this part. The different library and runtime are described in separate parts. % TBD: add links to the new parts
