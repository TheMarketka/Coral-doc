\chapter{About The Gear Feature Requests}
\label{sec:about}

Gear Feature Requests (GFRs) are documents specifying or requesting particular properties of Gear-related software base. 

Some CFRs are mandatory for a proper Gear implementation, some are optional, and in some cases, various parts of a Gear implementation may opt-into using them, either statically, or even dynamically. 

CFRs 0 to 2 are mandatory for every proper Gear implementation. 

CFRs are in no way static documents, they evolve in time and should be versioned from \code{0.1} up, including changelogs. Community is welcome to contribute to CFRs via pull requests to:

\begin{lstlisting}
  https://github.com/gear-lang/gear-doc
\end{lstlisting}

Under that GitHub organization, more repositories are located, and those can be contributed to the same way, but changes to them must be synchronized with changes to CFRs. Basically, this means that a change has to be accepted and merged first at CFR level, only then it can be merged into other repositories as well. 

To report bugs and any other issues with Gear software, please use issue tracker at:

\begin{lstlisting}
  https://github.com/gear-lang/gear-doc/issues
\end{lstlisting}

To report issues related particularly to other repositories, please use their appropriate issues tracker at GitHub.
